**Persistent To-Do List Application**

In this project, I've developed a To-Do List application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a unique feature â€“ data persistence. The application not only allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks seamlessly but also ensures that the to-do list remains intact even after refreshing the browser.

The user interface is clean and intuitive, with a visually appealing design. Users can effortlessly add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them when necessary. The application employs local storage to store the to-do list data, enabling the preservation of tasks across browser sessions.

This persistence feature enhances user experience, providing continuity and convenience. It transforms the to-do list from a temporary planning tool to a reliable task manager that adapts to users' habits. The application's architecture is designed to efficiently manage data, ensuring that tasks are seamlessly retrieved and stored, maintaining a consistent and up-to-date to-do list for users.

Overall, this To-Do List application not only assists users in organizing their tasks effectively but also showcases the power of data persistence, offering a seamless and hassle-free task management experience. Whether you're a productivity enthusiast or simply looking for a practical to-do list solution, this application demonstrates the fusion of functionality and user-friendly design.
